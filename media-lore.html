            Established by John Winchester in 2011 Squash'Emâ„¢ has been
            successfully exterminating mosquitoes all around the globe for many
            years now. But just how exactly did this company come to be? How was
            the fire necessary to fight this evil lit? And who exactly is the
            man at the at the very forefront of this never-ending battle?
            <br />
            <br />
            The story goes that once while only but a young child Mr. Winchester
            witnessed his parents getting bit by mosquitoes. Out of nowhere they
            came, countless numbers of them, and just like that in a mere
            instant...it was over.
            <br />
            This event has left a mark on him that has lasted for his entire
            life, and ever since that day he swore vengeance on the entire
            mosquito race.
            <br />
            <br />
            But is this true? Was this really that happened? The story has been
            nothing but hush tones and silent whispers among the workers in the
            company for years. But now finally after more than a decade we have
            the man himself step up and tell us the story. The story of
            <span id="media-bold-text">Squash'Em</span>.

            My name is John. My world is darkness and blood.
            <br />
            Once, I was a hunter, a warrior searching for a righteous cause.
            <br />
            <br />
            As the buzzing grew silent, each of us, in our own way, was broken.
            It was hard to know who bled more...
            <br />
            Me or everyone else.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here they come again. Buzzing their way into the black matter of my
            brain.
            <br />
            I tell myself... they cannot bite me.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are long squashed.
